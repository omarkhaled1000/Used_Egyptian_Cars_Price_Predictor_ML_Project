# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
## DATASET LICENSE
This project uses the dataset [Used Cars Prices in Egypt]([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yousifahmedanwar/used-cars-prices-in-egypt)), which is licensed under the GNU GPL v2.0.  
The dataset is redistributed (if included) under the same license.  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts used car prices based on attributes such as brand, model, year, fuel type, mileage, engine capacity, transmission, body type, color, and governorate.  
It also provides two ways to interact with the trained model:

1. **Locally** via a Flask web app (`app.py`).  
2. **Online** via a Streamlit app (deployed on Streamlit Cloud).

## 🔮 Future Improvements Vision

Deploy a full backend + database to store user predictions and feedback.
Improve the dataset by adding more diverse car brands and newer models.
Experiment with deep learning models for regression.
Add more visualizations in the Streamlit app (feature impact, SHAP plots).
Deploy the project on Docker and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure) for scalability.
